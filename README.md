# ðŸ“§ Naive Bayes Spam Detection

**A machine learning project for detecting spam emails using the Naive Bayes algorithm, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build a **spam detection model** using **Naive Bayes** in Python.  
The workflow includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF**
- Training and evaluating a **Naive Bayes classifier**
- Measuring performance with accuracy and classification metrics

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords
  - Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Bag of Words
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Modeling:**
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (common for text classification)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
